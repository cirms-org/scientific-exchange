SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGE ON MODELING & SIMULATION FOR RADIATION STERILIZATION

October 6, 2025

## Slide 2

Science & Engineering of Radiation Processing (SERP)

## Slide 3

Occurred September 16-17, 2025, at National Institute of Standards and Technology

Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Experts from industry, academia, regulatory bodies, and standards organizations collaborated to advance modeling for radiation sterilization.
Consensus and Roadmap Development
Roughly 50 participants focused on building consensus and shaping a roadmap for robust, traceable modeling and simulation methods.
Agenda
Over two days, the scientific exchange at NIST featured plenary talks, breakout sessions, and panel discussions that traced the evolution of modeling in radiation processing and regulatory science, explored lessons from radiation oncology, identified barriers and opportunities for standardization, showcased real-world case studies and a mock FDA submission validating simulation against physical measurements, and concluded with collaborative planning for standards development, regulatory engagement, and future exchanges.

Scientific Exchange Highlights

## Slide 4

Functional Equivalence
Technical insights from the event highlighted the versatility and value of modeling in radiation sterilization, emphasizing that functional equivalence—achieving the same safety and efficacy outcomes as physical testing—is central to the acceptance of simulation methods.
Modeling vs Physical Testing
Monte Carlo simulations, using tools like RayXpert and MCNP, enable accurate dose mapping, shielding design, and validation against physical measurements, which are essential for ensuring device safety and efficacy, especially when physical testing is impractical.
Real-world Application Examples
Industry, academia, and government case studies presented by Johnson&Johnson, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the National Institute of Health.

## Slide 5

Regulatory Insights & Modeling

Modeling as Regulatory Evidence

A mock FDA submission demonstrated how RayXpert simulation can be integrated into regulatory filings for radiation sterilization. The primary objective of this mock FDA Q-submission is to demonstrate how simulation data aligns with Performance Qualification (PQ) measurements, thereby supporting the device's regulatory justification. 

Standards and Programs

The FDA recognizes simulation modeling as credible evidence for device submissions, ensuring scientific rigor and credibility. ASME V&V 40-2018 standard and the MDDT program support reliable model credibility and streamline device submissions.

Simulation for Compliance and Innovation

Mock submissions using validated simulations show how modeling aids regulatory compliance and supports innovative device development.

## Slide 6

Consensus on Standardization
Despite success in other sectors, modeling for industrial sterilization remains underutilized, slowing innovation and efficiency improvements. Participants agreed on the importance of unified standards for verification, validation, and quantifying uncertainty to ensure reliability.
Identified Key Barriers
Absence of clear guidance and scientific consensus makes it difficult to implement modeling practices widely and consistently. Major barriers are training gaps, insufficient quality metrics, and regulatory acceptance, impacting progress and safety.
Action Plan for Advancement
There is a strong demand for robust frameworks addressing verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification in modeling.
Next steps involve developing standards, organizing round-robin studies, and embedding priorities in strategic reports for innovation.
