Scientific Exchange on Modeling and Simulation for Radiation Sterilization

September 16-17, 2025

## Slide 2

Overview

The modeling workshop was a focused two-day scientific exchange on modeling and simulation for radiation processing, held at NIST in September 2025.
The event brought together government, industry, academia, and regulatory stakeholders to address how mathematical modeling could be better integrated into radiation sterilization processes.
Workshop Structure and Participants
The workshop featured morning presentations covering radiation simulation, mathematical methods, and radiation therapy perspectives, followed by afternoon breakout sessions focused on building credibility and developing standards.
Key Problem Identified
The central challenge addressed was that while mathematical modeling works well in radiation oncology and other industries, it’s not routinely used in radiation sterilization workflows.
The primary barrier is economic - dose mapping costs $5,000-$10,000, while benchmarking a mathematical model can cost $50,000-$100,000, making the investment difficult to justify.

“Same” Problem, except for dose and scale

Focused clinical beam (2 Gy to ~1 cm region):
Objective: deliver a low dose precisely to a small, localized volume
Challenge: complex modeling and simulation to account for scattering, heterogeneity of tissues, beam shaping, and patient-specific anatomy
Verification: relies heavily on computational modeling, treatment planning systems, and imaging, with physical measurements used sparingly for quality assurance.

Large-scale processing (20 kGy to ~1 m region):
Objective: deliver a very high dose uniformly to a large bulk product
Challenge: relies on uniformity and reproducibility across pallets or containers, where modeling plays a smaller role and physical dosimetry is the foundation for process control.
Verification: traceable physical dosimetry, with routine dose mapping and reproducibility checks to confirm uniformity across the irradiation volume

## Slide 5

Major Outcomes

1. Framework for Credibility
The workshop established that any modeling approach must be tied to known dosimetry standards.
The consensus was to build a framework based on continuous testing with dosimetry, combining virtual dosimetry with physical measurements rather than replacing them entirely.
2. Three Key Application Areas
Participants identified where modeling could make the biggest impact:
Enhancing dosimetry: Reducing physical dosimetry requirements in performance qualification (PQ) submissions and guiding optimal dosimeter placement
Supporting parametric release: Using models to set process parameter bounds without testing each scenario physically
Advancing regulatory submissions: Particularly through FDA’s master file pilot program
3. Regulatory Support
A significant finding was that regulators want to see more simulation in radiation sterilization - they just need proper justification.
The FDA representatives emphasized they’re supportive of modeling approaches when credibility is demonstrated.

## Slide 6

Major Outcomes and Consensus, continued

Technical Requirements Identified
The workshop highlighted several technical needs:
Standardized phantoms for model validation
Proficiency testing programs similar to those in radiation therapy
Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis protocols
Competency assessment frameworks for modelers

## Slide 7

Action Items

Foundational
Establish consensus standards and quality systems for verification, validation, and quality assurance, leveraging existing frameworks and organizations (e.g., ASTM, AAPM).
Develop a library of validated use cases with specific application contexts to demonstrate credibility and impact.
Create proficiency testing programs that incorporate modeling components to benchmark performance and build confidence.
Strategic Development
Form a CDRH-led working group to develop a specific use case and roadmap, including exploration of consortium funding mechanisms to support project development.
Develop a white paper articulating the benefits of modeling from multiple stakeholder perspectives, serving as a unifying reference and outreach tool.
Communication and Engagement
Organize a webinar to summarize meeting outcomes, highlight action items, and engage broader stakeholders.

## Slide 8

Challenges and Limitations

The workshop identified that more focused time was needed to hammer out implementation details.
While the framework was established, significant work remains to develop the specific standards and validation approaches needed for widespread adoption.
The event successfully demonstrated strong collaboration potential between radiation sterilization and radiation therapy communities, with significant cross-pollination of ideas and approaches between the two fields.
