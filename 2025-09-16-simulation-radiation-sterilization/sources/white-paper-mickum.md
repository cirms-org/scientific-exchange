White Paper Summary

September 16--17, 2025

NIST Gaithersburg Campus

# Background & Rationale

The Scientific Exchange on Modeling and Simulation for Radiation Sterilization, held at the NIST Gaithersburg campus in September 2025, brought together a diverse group of stakeholders from industry, academia, regulatory agencies, and standards organizations. The central challenge addressed at this event was the limited adoption of mathematical modeling and simulation in routine industrial radiation sterilization workflows, despite their proven value in related fields such as radiation therapy. The exchange was co-hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Council on Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards (CIRMS), with the explicit aim of advancing consensus and developing a roadmap for robust, traceable modeling practices.

The rationale for convening this exchange stemmed from the recognition that, while modeling and simulation are integral to high-reliability industries, their use in sterilization is hampered by a lack of standardized guidance, scientific consensus, and quality assurance infrastructure. The absence of clear frameworks for verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification has led to inconsistent practices and diminished confidence in modeling as a supplement or alternative to physical testing. The event sought to bridge these gaps by fostering dialogue among technical experts, healthcare product manufacturers, sterilization contractors, standards developers, and academic institutions.

# Exchange Structure & Key Topics

Over two days, the exchange featured plenary talks, breakout sessions, and panel discussions designed to maximize cross-disciplinary learning and actionable outcomes. The first day opened with reflections on the historical evolution of modeling in radiation processing and regulatory science, highlighting milestones such as the FAA's acceptance of flight simulators and previously benchmarked electron beam simulation models. The FDA's progressive adoption of computational modeling in drug and device approvals was also discussed, illustrating how simulation has matured from an academic tool to a cornerstone of regulatory science. Lessons from radiation oncology were presented, emphasizing the importance of rigorous metrology, traceability, and quality assurance in treatment planning and clinical practice. Breakout sessions focused on identifying gaps in equipment capability, modeling competency, and regulatory requirements, with participants working collaboratively to pinpoint barriers to model adoption and opportunities for standardization.

The second day shifted toward practical applications and future directions. Industry and academic case studies showcased real-world examples of modeling in device development, regulatory submissions, and clinical applications. A mock FDA submission was presented, demonstrating how dose mapping validation using RayXpert simulation software can align computational results with physical measurements and meet ISO 11137 compliance. This example illustrated the potential for simulation data to supplement or even replace physical testing, provided that rigorous validation and benchmarking are performed. Collaborative sessions throughout the day were dedicated to defining next steps, including the development of standards, engagement with regulatory agencies, and planning for future scientific exchanges.

# Technical Insights & Case Studies

Technical insights from the event underscored the versatility and value of modeling in radiation sterilization. Functional equivalence was central to the goal of the scientific exchange, as participants sought to establish that modeling and simulation methods in radiation sterilization can be considered successful and acceptable when they reliably achieve the same safety and efficacy outcomes as traditional physical testing, even if the specific approach or details differ. Functional equivalence in modeling means that a process or product achieves the intended outcome or meets the required standards, even if the specific details or pathway differ from the traditional or expected approach. To visualize this, imagine an airplane landing on a runway: it does not matter whether the plane touches down exactly on the center line or slightly off-center, if the landing is safe and successful. The essential goal is a safe arrival, not perfect alignment---just as in modeling, the critical measure is whether the model delivers reliable, validated results, not whether every detail matches a specific precedent.

Monte Carlo simulations, implemented through tools such as RayXpert and MCNP, enable accurate dose mapping, shielding design, and validation against physical measurements. These methods are essential for ensuring device safety and efficacy, particularly in scenarios where physical testing is challenging or impractical. The plenary talks included a discussion about how Monte Carlo simulation can be applied to corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) processes, using the sterilization and simulation of cardiovascular stents as an example. Although the results shared were preliminary, they demonstrated the effectiveness of variance analysis, provided additional data to support defect resolution, helped identify cases where corrective actions may be necessary, and contributed to setting limits for preventive actions.

The Modeling Software in Practice presentation showcased a range of simulation techniques used in regulatory science and radiation sterilization. These included finite element analysis for structural mechanics, computational fluid dynamics for modeling fluid flow and heat transfer, and Monte Carlo methods for probabilistic modeling and radiation transport. The slides also highlighted applications such as bench testing simulations, digital twin patient models, radiation shielding design, and dose mapping for medical devices. Together, these simulation approaches illustrate how advanced computational tools are driving innovation, improving safety, and supporting regulatory submissions in the field.

# Mock Q-Submission 

With representatives posing as a FDA regulator, the simulation service provider, and the product manufacture, this demonstration provided a detailed example of how advanced simulation tools, specifically RayXpert, may be integrated into regulatory submissions for radiation sterilization. In this case, Monte Carlo-based dose mapping was used to model the radiation dose distribution within a medical device, and the simulation results were rigorously validated against physical performance qualification (PQ) measurements. The comparative analysis showed that the deviations between simulated and measured dose values were functionally equivalent, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy and reliability. This close alignment not only supports the credibility of the simulation tool but also meets the stringent requirements set forth by ISO 11137, which governs standards for radiation sterilization.

By achieving such precise agreement between computational and physical data, the submission enhances regulatory confidence in the use of modeling and simulation as credible evidence. The mock Q-submission further illustrates how simulation can be leveraged to identify the bounds of an uncertainty budget, where sensitivity studies on key variables allows for understanding of their significance to the overall results. These capabilities are especially valuable in contexts where physical measurement is challenging or impractical. Overall, the example underscores the growing role of validated simulation in streamlining regulatory review, improving safety assurance, and supporting innovation in medical device sterilization.

# Regulatory Perspectives

Regulatory perspectives were a focal point of the exchange. The FDA's recognition of computational modeling and simulation as credible evidence in device submissions was discussed in detail, with recent guidance emphasizing risk-informed frameworks for model credibility, verification, and validation. The ASME V&V 40-2018 standard provides structured methods for assessing model credibility based on context of use and risk, while the Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program streamlines regulatory submissions by qualifying simulation tools and reducing the need for repeated validation. These initiatives collectively foster innovation, reduce regulatory burden, and promote confidence in digital evidence.

# Outcomes & Roadmap

The outcomes of the exchange were significant. Participants reached consensus on the need for standardized methods of verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification. Key barriers to adoption were identified, including insufficient training, inconsistent quality metrics, and limited regulatory acceptance. Action items emerging from the event included the development of standards for model qualification, the promotion of round-robin studies for cross-validation, and the integration of these priorities into the next CIRMS Needs Report to guide NIST's future work.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the 2025 Scientific Exchange at NIST represented a pivotal step toward integrating modeling and simulation into the practice of radiation sterilization. By building consensus, sharing technical expertise, and engaging with regulators, the community is well-positioned to advance innovation, safety, and efficiency in sterilization practices. Continued collaboration and standards development will be essential to realizing the full potential of modeling as a robust, traceable tool for product validation and regulatory compliance.
